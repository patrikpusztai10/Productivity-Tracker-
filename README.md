# Productivity-Tracker-
This is a productivity tracker and task manager created in Java.

This project focuses on three types of users: teamleaders, employees and admins, all with different roles and possible tasks.
The GUI is done using Java FX. 
We attached a data base in MySQL to this project through a JDBC driver. The access to data bases is restricted using roles, depending on the data stored in the data base(only teamleaders can insert tasks in the tasks db, etc),
